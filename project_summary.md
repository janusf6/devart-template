## Description
A moment into an icon- A symbol with loaded meaning beyond itself. 
By breaking a concept down to its atomic parts, and reconstructing it using a set of rules, anything can be immortalised with an icon.
My idea is to invite the user to choose a point in the world, combined with a point in time- a moment significant to them (either personally or historically) and break it down to its coordinates in space-time. I will then reconstruct this moment as a computationally generated image, an icon- unique and meaningful to them. Bringing sentiment and generative art together.
One step further, I will have the "Current Moment" at the user's location, which will be brought alive, constantly changing as time progresses- a perpetual animation.
