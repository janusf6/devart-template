<h2>begin</h2>
<p>To start with there is the idea.
The debate over the merit of the idea, the aesthetics possibilities of the concept. 
The un-surety that keeps open the possibility for good solutions to present themselves, the foundation and promise for better ideas to come.
</p>
<p>
<strong>From an aesthetic standpoint</strong>
I do not know how the piece will look- I know how I want it to 'feel'.  Interesting when seen for the first time -maybe incomprehensible, although simpler may be a better idea. Each resulting icon should be unique to the parameters, distinguishable to the degree of change in these parameters. There should be a balance though between individuality and a uniformity of style. They should not appear ramshackle.  <br>
With this in mind I am leaning toward a 3D modelling representation. A digital sculpture will be able to carry more information coherently than a sketch.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Conceptually</strong>
I want to create a clear personal affinity between the user and the generated image. More importantly I want to capture The Present in a way previously unexplored. This moment, here, now. 
<br> I want to include gps coordinates, date-time, but also elevation above sea-level. As if you could divide the entire world and sky, the entire history, into a grid, break it down into atoms, and reconstruct it piece by piece, moment by moment.
<br>
I am very curious to see if this reconstitution of time and space will turn out to seem merely trivial, or if there is (as I hope) a magic of imagining: this block of sky 2m above you, as a geometric tesselation.
<br>
Or of getting lost in the slow mutation of my representation of this current moment, all passing through this single point directly in front of you.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Technically Speaking</strong>
<br>  I will let the process of implementation guide the final result. This is where the generative part of the project will come out. The other important technical aspect is the User interaction. The user should quickly and easily be able to choose their desired location and time, or choose a "here-and-now" button. 
The look-and-feel is very important- the first impression, it will serve as an introduction to the rest of the piece.
<p>I will try and keep it as accessible as possible- a web-based implementation: javascript, Google Maps, and webGl spring to mind first.

<p>
<strong>Going forward</strong>
I need to start vigourously experimenting with some visuals- 3D generative art, perhaps finding libraries to help, find and work out the technical problems as they present themselves while holding this initial motivated unsurety, stashed safely in the back of my head to be retrieved later, when the space is safer...
